# My Phone Walked Into A Bar

My phone walked into a bar and said to the bartender, "Can you call me a cab?" The bartender said, "You're a cab." My phone said, "Thanks, I needed that." Then aliens landed in the parking lot and started selling grapefruit. When they were done my phone hitched a ride with them to Planet 9 and I've been frantically setting and unsetting the alarm on my digital watch ever since.
