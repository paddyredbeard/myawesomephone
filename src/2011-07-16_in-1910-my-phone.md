In 1910 my phone walked into a dusty Mexican village and healed a leper and a blind man.  The blind man took my phone home to meet his mother.  The two courted for a time, but it soon became clear my phone was more interested in sandwiches than love, and they parted ways. The man joined the Zapatistas and was later wounded when his rifle misfired.  My phone wandered for 3 years and was sometimes known to sleep in an alley behind a bicycle shop in New Jersey.  The leper became a sushi chef.
