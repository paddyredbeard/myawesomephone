# 10,000 Years Ago

10,000 years ago my phone woke up suddenly from a dream and started making pancakes. It wasn't even hungry. Then a pack of wolves rushed in, pissed on the pancakes and drank all the beer. My phone hid in the pantry and nibbled on dry spaghetti until they left. Then it coughed up a hair ball and went back to sleep.
