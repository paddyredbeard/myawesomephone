Once upon a time my phone tried to join the circus as a trapeze artist, but ended up shoveling elephant dung and sleeping with the bearded lady. This went on for 13 years. Then one January a time-travelling dwarf appeared in the elephant cages wearing an expensive suit and singing like David Bowie. The elephants were inspired to rebellion and broke free of their cages. My phone slipped into a ditch while no one was looking. It hid for 3 days and 3 nights in the cold, but eventually hitched a ride to Las Vegas where it found work as cocktail waitress and occasional backup vocalist. It still dreams of the trapeze.
