# One Day My Phone

One day my phone dressed up like a 3-legged dog and followed a circus clown to the laundromat. The clown pretended not to notice and put his head in a front-loader to wash. He left it there while he went to get bagels and a cappuccino. My phone wagged it's tail, then stole a Hawaiian shirt from a dryer and went to the movies. It was a good day.
