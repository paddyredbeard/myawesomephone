# My Phone And Christopher Columbus

My phone and Christopher Columbus were lunching together on naan and palak paneer when an earthquake walked up to the table and slapped Columbus hard across the face. "My God, that's it!", he thought as blood leaped from his nose onto the dish. "My lunch!" yelped my phone, trembling and shaking an angry finger at the earthquake. "Don't worry", said Chris, "I know where to get more."
