# 47 Cat, 2 Prize Bulls, And My Phone

47 cats, 2 prize bulls, and my phone went on a road trip. My phone was driving. Half-way there the cats wanted ice cream. My phone pulled into a Dairy Queen and all the cats got soft-serve. The bulls ordered cheese burgers. My phone beeped uncomfortably and one of the cats exploded. The journey continued but no one talked very much after that.
