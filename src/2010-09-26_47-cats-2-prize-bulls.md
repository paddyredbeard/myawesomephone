47 cats, 2 prize bulls, and my phone went on a road trip.  My phone was driving.  Half-way there the cats wanted ice cream.  My phone pulled into a Dairy Queen and all the cats got soft-serve.  The bulls ordered cheese burgers.  My phone beeped uncomfortably and one of the cats exploded.  The journey continued but no one talked very much after that.
