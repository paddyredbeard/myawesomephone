# In 1957 On A Rainy Day

In 1957 on a rainy day in France, my phone sneezed on a man who looked like Fidel Castro wearing a woolly hat.  The man was sitting astride a giraffe-shaped cushion and discussing paranormal existentialism with a yellow rain jacket.  My phone saluted him and smiled, then did the moon walk into a Lebanese cafe where it lunched on falafel and pickles.  It was the best falafel ever.
